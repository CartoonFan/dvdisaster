<h3 class="top">Installation of the source packages</h3>

dvdisaster uses the common <tt>./configure; make; make install</tt> mechanism
for installation from source. Please see the file <tt>INSTALL</tt> in the
source distribution for further information.

<h3>Installation of the binary for Windows</h3>

Please install the Windows version by executing the setup binary
(e.g. <?php echo ${pkgname}?>-setup.exe) and follow the 
installation dialog. <p>

<b>Caution:</b> dvdisaster can NOT be installed from
manually unpacking the setup.exe program, or by copying it from
an already existing installation. Doing so may result in strange
errors which seem to be totally unrelated to an improper installation.
