CURRENTLY WORKING ON

- 0.70: full RS02 integration into the graphical user interface

ROADMAP

- 0.72: introduce multi threading for multicore processor support

TODO  (with no particular order / schedule)

- add real UDF parsing to udf.c 
  (currently only the backward compatibility ISO structures are used)

- Provide a deep verify method which calculates and tests the error
  syndrome for each image byte.

- Optimize the decoding (fixing) part

- Graceful handling of situations where the SCSI/IDE bus 
  becomes temporarily unavailable (does this happen on ATAPI at all?)

- See if we can support the graphical GNU Installer 

- Add support for .h2i files
