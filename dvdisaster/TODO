CURRENTLY WORKING ON

- devising a strategy to put ecc information on the same media as the image,
  using the left-over space for error correction information (within the
  bounds of meaningful redundancies, of course).


TODO  (in no particular order)

- introduce multi threading for multicore processor support

- add real UDF parsing to udf.c 
  (currently only the backward compatibility ISO structures are used)

- Provide a deep verify method which calculates and tests the error
  syndrome for each image byte.

- Optimize the decoding (fixing) part

- Graceful handling of situations where the SCSI/IDE bus 
  becomes temporarily unavailable (does this happen on ATAPI at all?)

- See if we can support the graphical GNU Installer 

- Add support for .h2i files
