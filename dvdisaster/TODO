CURRENTLY WORKING ON

- 0.70: full RS02 integration into the graphical user interface

ROADMAP

- 0.72: introduce multi threading for multicore processor support

TODO  (with no particular order / schedule)

- let user select the number of reading passes so that a defective
  medium can be read in several passed overnight

- provide a function for searching directories for suitable .ecc files 
  for the current image

- add real UDF parsing to udf.c 
  (currently only the backward compatibility ISO structures are used)

- Graceful handling of situations where the SCSI/IDE bus 
  becomes temporarily unavailable (does this happen on ATAPI at all?)

- See if we can support the graphical GNU Installer 

- Add support for .h2i files
