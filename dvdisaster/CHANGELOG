	  interoperability between RS02 ecc images and burning software

0.65 (devel-3) 11-02-2006
	- Creation of image and ecc files can be resumed after going
	  out of disc space (only in GUI mode)

	- created contrib directory; added desktop and rpm skeletons
	  contributed by Lubos Stanek
	- changed length query for SCSI opcode 0xad 
	- changed length calculation for SCSI opcode 0x43

	- added CRC testing during linear read and scan options
	  (if the respective ecc file is present)
	- added flags for marking development versions and release candidates	
          in the ecc file versiom information
	- removed some memory leaks in the windows version

0.65 (devel-1) 22-01-2006
	- fixed several places in Makefile to handle source tree from CVS properly
	- reorganized documentation scripts to better separate HTML markup
          from translated phrases (dictionary_xx functions)
	- removed language selection from online manual
	- separated documentation image archives by language
	- fixed crash when documentation was not properly installed
	- added --buildroot option to configure
	  (thanks to D. Baumann and V. Kuhlmann for explaining the need for this!)

0.65: 14-01-2006
	- Czech translation by Lubos Stanek
	- made invocation of external HTML viewer more flexible and robust
	- started support for big endian archs (NOT completed yet!)
	- modularized scsi and codec interface for easier future expansion
	- made --random-errors use the internal random number generator
	  and allow for independent selection of number of roots/erasures
	- Error correction files can be larger than 2GB on FAT file systems
	- changed medium fingerprint sector from 257 to 16 (ISO file system root block)
	- Windows binaries are now shipped with Gtk+2.6 libraries
	- CRC information is calculated and cached when reading the image
	  so that we do not need to re-read the image in a subsequent create operation.
	- tinkered with speed curve algorithm to get smoother lines
	- made sector color markers during linear read more understandable (hopefully)
	- configure will now correctly honor $LDFLAGS from the user environment
	- added Gtk+ library localization files to Windows distribution
	  (thanks to J. Meyer for reporting this problem!)
	- fixed bug in the Errors/Ecc block graph which would make it scale incorrectly
	  if uncorrectable errors are encountered (this was just a rendering problem
	  with no influence on the actual error correction)
	- added gdk pixbuf check to configure (thanks to W. Wershofen for noting this!)
	- better error diagnosis for invalid ecc files (thanks to Lubos for noting this!)
	- modified code to compile cleanly under gcc 4.02

0.64.2: 01-11-2005
	- fixed crash when using -u in command line mode
	- changed packaging system to allow different package and version numbering systems
	  Current naming scheme is:
	  . package name = package directory    = 0.xx[.y]
	  . version name (as advertised in GUI) = 0.xx[ (pl y)]
	- fixed img file permissions for Linux version
	- drive selection wasn't remembered between sessions under
	  Gtk+-2.4 and higher: fixed
	- Manual/Homepage fixed for some MSIE glitches

0.64.1: 23-10-2005
	- fixed bug which activated automatic ecc file generation in scan mode
	- fixed crash at startup when linked against Gtk+ 2.6
	  (Thanks to Radu M. and Richard B. for noting this!)

0.64: 18-10-2005
	- reworked console and logging output:
	  Got rid of \b usage in locale files, 
	  making gawk filtering of diagnostic warning obsolete.
	  More removal of read and CRC error reporting in GUI mode as buffering 
	  them may result in going out of memory in worst case situations.
	  Use the program in command line mode and apply file 
          redirection if you still wish to see these messages.
	- fixed a glitch in the linear read/scanning GUI 
	  which prevented small unreadable areas to stay 
	  marked red in the spiral 
	- fixed bug which did not install the CREDITS.* files
	- fixed configure to use the --prefix settings properly 
	  (thanks to Daniel Baumann for pointing this out)
	- added de/en/it man pages supplied by Daniel Baumann
	- fixed non-working --spinup-delay command line arg
        - added configurable --docsubdir at request of Daniel
	- Changed linear reading strategy
	  . Sector skipping after a read error is now done in all passes, 
	    not just the first one (the previous behaviour turned out as 
	    an arbitrary design decision which did not really make sense)
	  . Re-reading passes are carried out in 16 sector chunks, too
	- provided workaround for detecting CD media on Teac slimline
	  drives (and possibly others) caused by silly firmware answers
	- provided workaround for read errors which are reported
	  as something else by sloppy firmware
	- added debugging functions --random-image and --random-seed for creating
	  images with "random" numbers. Images created with --random-seed n are
	  bitwise mirrors of those created with --random-seed -n.
	- hunted down some memory leaks
	- turned warning dialogs into modal dialogs
	- fixed some minor redraw flaws in adaptive read mode
	- fixed automatic file removal bug when in FAT32 mode 
	  (thanks to Peter H., Walter G and Stephan J. for noting this)
	- fixed error handling in GUI mode: in some rare error situations,
	  it would not bring up the intended error dialog, but either
	  continue quietly or terminate the whole program.
	- fixed empty drive pop down menu after changing drives in the system
	  or sharing a dvdisaster installation between different Windows installations
	- started support for parsing ISO file system structures
	- added some recent drives to the drive data base
	- rewrote the drive spinup code
	- added function for automatically creating the .ecc file after
	  successfully reading an image
	- documentation partially rewritten
	- added some code to make sure that the "read adaptive" spiral fits into the window
	- removed flicker in the "read adaptive" mode text output 

0.63: 01-08-2005
	- added adaptive read strategy (thanks to Harald BÃ¶geholz
	  for the suggestion; see also the CREDITS file)
	- added --fill-unreadble option for better compatibility with
	  other tools (e.g. h2cdimage from c't magazine)
	- cut down information written to the log window in GUI mode 
	  as that could use up significant amounts of memory in worst 
          case scenarios. Use command line mode if you are still interested
	  in these messages.
	- fixed code for clean compile with gcc 4.0.1
	- added auto-suffix option for automatically adding .img/.ecc to files
	  given without an extension (thanks to Marcus for the suggestion!)
	- changed function test prototype in bash based configure from
	  char* to char to work around misdetection of gcc's builtin gettext()
	  (thanks to Heinz R. for pointing this out)
	- fixed crash in About requester when LANG environment was not set
	  (thanks to Andreas for the patch!) 

0.62: 03-07-2005
	- added correct return codes to indicate whether reading
	  succeeded or found bad sectors in command line mode
	- added experimental support for splitting image files into 2GB chunks
	  (mainly for use with VFAT an Win9x; avoid this mode if you can)
	- added compare function to graphical user interface
	- fixed 'make install' (thanks to Andreas for noting the problems)
	- fixed german umlaut glitch in the foot line (thanks to GoldenFingaz
	  for pointing this out)
	- relaxed handling of image size mismatches
	
0.61: 24-04-2005
	- added preferences dialog
	- decoupled command line settings from GUI settings so that
	  command line arguments will not be remembered across sessions
	  and GUI settings will not be used in command line mode.
	- more image size detection fine tuning (this becomes a running gag, huh?)
	- added --speed-warning option (thanks to Richard B. for the suggestion!)
	- added --spinup-delay option
	- removed startup-related downspike in the speed graph

0.60: 09-04-2005
	- first release with graphical user interface
	- tinkered again with image size detection
	- added debugging function for zeroing out the "unreadable sector"
	  markers (thanks to Marcus J. for the suggestion!)
	- made configure more compatible with autoconf behaviour 
	  (thanks to Andreas for pointing out the differences!)

0.55: 20-02-2005
	- added Italian translation from Andrea Polverini (polve@polve.com)
	- improved media type detection
	- upward compatibility with the improved media footprint calculation
	  from upcoming version 0.60

0.54: 01-01-2005
	- Switched from Cygwin/cygwin1.dll to Mingw/msvcrt.dll,
	  with some additional functionality taken over by glib2.
	  This may cause some short-time inconvenience (please report
	  all different behaviour relative to 0.53.1!),
	  but will pay off in later versions. 
	- Some code reorganization.
	- Shortened the version number scheme to major.minor
	- Removed visualization via gnuplot. Visualization will be
	  re-introduced in version 0.60; please use version 0.53.1
	  for visualization if needed.
	- Reworked compilation instructions in documentation.

0.53.1: 27-12-2004
	- encrypted discs will be rejected before any actual reading
	  is attempted (avoids confusing error messages when running into
	  the encrypted area).

0.53.0: 23-12-2004
	- introduction of GNU gettext
	- German localization
	- Makefile will automatically collect .c files
	- Preparation for multiple codecs
	- fixed incorrect media size calculation for +RW images
	- fixed installation procedure (thanks to Kay D. !)

0.52.1: 04-12-2004
	- Fixed the handling of truncated image files (thanks to Harald B.!)
	- Better diagnosis of images which are longer than supposed
	  (should never happen, but one never knows)

0.52.0: 28-11-2004
	- codec speedups and user selectable redundancy settings

0.51.1: 13-11-2004
	- fixed bug which prevented dvdisaster from working
	  under Windows XP without Cygwin being installed
	  (thanks to Andrea and Harald B. for reporting this!)
	- removed unnecessary open with write permission 
	  within --test action
	- Besides bringing scanning speed to a screeching halt on
	  slow systems, calculation of the image md5sum during
	  the --scan option wasn't very useful -- removed it.
	- repaired a glitch which would derail the codec when
	  fixing a truncated image
	- added --dao option
	- added a test predicting a TAO medium when fixing a
	  damaged image
	
0.51.0: 06-11-2004
	- added experimental ASPI support for Cygwin version
	- added alternative "-end" syntax for specifying the sector range
	- added -j/--jump option
	- fixed minor bug which made -t option fail reading the CRC data
	  on very small media images
	
0.50.0: 01-10-2004
	- Experimental Cygwin support.
	- Rewrote SCSI layer for portability.
	- Introduced ./configure mechanism.
	- Dropped --direct option for portability reasons.
	- Changed behaviour of continuing the reading of incomplete images;
	  if the image size is smaller than the medium size, reading will
	  now continue at the last read sector. Previous versions would have
	  tried all unread sectors before.
	- Fixed a bug which would not fill in the missing sector markers
	  on a sequence of non overlapping read intervals (such as doing
	  -r0-100000; -r110000-media_end; the range 100001-109999 would
	  have been simply zeroed out in previous versions).

0.42.2: 23-09-2004
	- changed the --fix semantics so that sectors with wrong CRC sums 
	  will automatically be fixed (previous versions would just report
	  them as bad when using the -t option)
	- made --fix more verbose about CRC errors

0.42.1: 11-09-2004
	- unrolled the inner codec loop; optimized some C expressions within
	- code cleanup in the encoder

0.42.0: (no public release)
	- changed the caching and code generation strategy in the RS encoder
	- added program version information in the ecc file header
	- updated the --print option to show the new header information
	- made --fix option reject .ecc files from future program versions

0.41.2: 05-09-2004
	- some speed optimizations in the encoder
	- the --direct option now actually works 
	- removed the #ifdef DEBUG clutter in ecc-rs01.c
	- added the --byteset debugging function

	NOTE: Debugging functions are intentionally undocumented and unsupported.

0.41.1: 31-08-2004
	- added CRC32 checksum for each image block in the .ecc file

0.41.0: 28-08-2004 (no public release)
	- Replaced the matrix-based codec with one using polynomials.

0.40.8: 24-08-2004 (no public release)
	- removed unused div_tab[] from ecc-rs01.c (which was incorrectly initialized anyways)
	- fixed md5sum miscompare in print.c	
	- added the --random-errors debugging function

	NOTE: Debugging functions are intentionally undocumented and unsupported.

0.40.7:	22-08-2004
	First public release
