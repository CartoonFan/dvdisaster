Unfortunately, the MMC3 SCSI spec is fuzzy on some aspects.
As a result, some functionalities are implemented differently
across various drives. dvdisaster tries to overcome these
differences by employing heuristics and a drive data base.

When dvdisaster is using information from the drive data base,
it appends [Note n] to the drive identification string, as in

  Device: /dev/hdc, ATAPI DVD+RW 8X4X12 B2K7 [Note 1]

See the following list for an explanation of these notes
and what the effect of the drive data base entry is.

If you have a drive which is not in this list, but behaves similar
to one already listed, please give me its identification string
(as in the Device: line above) to have it added to the drive data base.

Topic a) Medium capacity related entries

DVD+RW media have two interesting sizes:
The user area (= the number of sectors used/written so far)
and the maximum possible medium capacity.
Unfortunately, drive manufactures have not standardized on
how to retrieve these values (dvdisaster needs the user area size).

[Note 1] - use READ DVD STRUCTURE

Known drives in this category:

- BenQ DRW800A
- NEC ND-2500A

[Note 2] - use READ CAPACITY 

Known drives in this category:

- Pioneer DVD-ROM DVD-105F
- Pioneer DVD-ROM DVD-304


[Note 3] - use READ DVD STRUCTURE;
	 - does not report errors reading from the de-icing zone

These drives make the internal size heuristics fail 
since they do not report an error when reading past the end of the user area. 

Known drives in this category:

- LG GSA-4163B
- Plextor PX-716A
